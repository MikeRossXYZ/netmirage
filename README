This is NetMirage, a tool for testing unmodified IP-based network applications
using large virtual networks.

Complete documentation for NetMirage is available at:
https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/software/netmirage/

To compile the code, ensure that SCons is installed and run:
	scons

Use netmirage-core to set up a virtual network on the "core" machine. Use
netmirage-edge to allocate virtual addresses for applications running on "edge"
node machines. Traffic will be routed through the core. For information about
the operation of these commands, see the documentation webpage listed above or
