// This module provides a mechanism for actually performing the logical setup of
// virtual networks. It serves as a bridge between the "setup" module and the
// "net" module. All of the functions here are meant to be called from a single
// thread whose primary purpose is performing I/O operations. The calls are all
// asynchronous. If an error occurs, it is returned by subsequent calls before
// they perform their function. The join operation, which waits for all work to
// finish, will return any queued errors. Some calls automatically perform the
// join operation before or after executing; these cases are marked. A NULL
// return value indicates that no error was queued. If an error occurs while one
// is already queued, one of the errors will be dropped, so the caller is
// expected to cease all work operations after encountering an error.
